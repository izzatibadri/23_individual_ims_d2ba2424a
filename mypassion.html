<p>I love to do relaxing outdoor activities such as hiking and walking. Even though it is quiet tiring, it helps me relieve some stress. I like it is a good activity for health and to break away from my busy life as a student. As of now, I have climbed Bukit Keluang for two times. I went hiking with my siblings and my friends. It is the nearest hiking place I can go. However, I plan to go hike somewhere further in Malaysia. It might be later in life, but I hope to go to Kinabalu one day. I think it will be a great experience and memory.</p>

<p>The photo below is my brother, Saiful. The background is just mesmerizing!</p>

<p>Other than that, I love going to the beach. When I am home at Bachok, I will go to the beach to just stare at the sea and appreciate the calmness. Sounds very aesthetic, right? No, I went to the beach with my pajamas. So no good photos are taken. I will only dress well to the beach if my friend were to do some photo shoot. Just kidding, but yes. I love going to the beach and I hope the beaches in Malaysia will stay beautiful as they are. It will be a waste if the beach are not taken care of. Nature needs to be preserve. </p>

<p>The photo below is quiet recent. I went to Terengganu with my friends in the end of June. It was a hot summer and we decided to go on a short vacation. We went for two days and one night. One of our destination were the beach in the photo. Well, I don't remember the name of the beach. But it was very beautiful too.</p>

<p>And sometimes, I would go explore the nature. Anywhere is fine honestly. I want to explore more of the world. Be it a jungle, river, mountain, a small park, and etc, I would love to go and experience. I also have the dream of traveling around Malaysia. I think I should to that to appreciate more of our country. I see a lot of people admiring other countries and not seeing more of Malaysia. It is such a waste.</p>

<p>The photo is taken at a beach slash mountain at Pahang. I think it is called Teluk Cempedak? I don't really remember. That is why I need the photo to remember. The place is very picturesque. It is almost out of a painting, or a painting itself. The beauty is not really captured with my smartphone's camera. But I guess that is the way for every pretty things I took picture of. They are more pretty in real life.</p>

<p>I hope the nature in Malaysia is preserve well for me and the future generation to see. To appreciate. Humans are supposed to take care of the world, not destroy it.</p>
<p>That is all for my passion, I guess I am quite a boring person. I have not much passion in things. But it is never too late to explore more and find other passion, right?</p>
